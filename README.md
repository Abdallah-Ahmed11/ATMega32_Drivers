# ATMega32_Drivers

This repository was created by Abdallah Ahmed and provides a structured set of drivers for AVR microcontrollers. The project follows a layered architecture approach for better maintainability and scalability, comprising MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer), HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), and essential libraries (LIB).

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to organize and implement AVR drivers in a modular fashion. Each driver is placed in a dedicated folder within the appropriate layer, ensuring clear separation of concerns. By following this structure, you can easily integrate new features, maintain existing drivers, and scale your applications.
